<li><p>Hi, My name is Barton Chittenden, I'm from ByWater Solutions. I am, among other things, one of the people that our partners reach when they call in to our support line. I'd like to talk about Koha from the perspective of someone who does technical support, and show how that fits in with the design of Koha.</p></li>
<li><p>So, before we go any further, I would like you to think about your last experience with a tech support phone call.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>By a show of hands, how many of you are</p>
<ul>
<li>picturing pressing phone buttons in an IVR system?</li>
<li>had a long wait on hold</li>
<li>got someone on the other end of the line who was reading of a script that included the words &quot;I'm sorry you're having trouble with your _____...&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Were you happy with your experience? Did the person on the other end of the line listen to you? Did you <em>really</em> believe them when they said they were sorry?</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that when you call into an enormous phone center, you're going to be talking to someone who is taking 150 calls a day, and who has been turned into a robot dealing with the same problems over and over again.</p>
<p>This isn't a good experience for anyone involved. One of the reasons for this is that...</p>

<p>&quot;A computer lets you make more mistakes faster than any other invention with the possible exceptions of handguns and Tequila.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Mitch Ratcliffe</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a previous life, I did support for a VoIP product, a lot like Vonage. We had a feature that we rushed into production. This feature didn't get adequately tested at scale, and it ended up crashing the entire phone network every 20 seconds. It took operations 3 days to figure this out. The whole time, I was left saying &quot;I'm sorry you're having trouble with your VoIP. Yes, we are aware of this issue; I don't have a resolution at this time&quot;. Those were the three longest days of my life in tech support. It sucked my compassion dry.</p></li>
<li><p>Koha isn't structured like this -- it's not deployed in a monolithic environment; it tends to be installed on a network of much smaller servers. However, one or more bad bugs in a major release <em>can</em> create a slow motion version of this, where support staff is not overwhelmed in a single day, but worn down over a period of time. The effects on our compassion, our ability to listen and communicate effectively are diminished, and that's bad for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>This talk is aimed at looking at some of the design decisions that would make Koha a little easier to support, either for a systems librarian at a site which has their own Koha instance, or for a support vendor.</p></li>
